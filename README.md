After stopping the playing scene, add the animation for the player's idle state. From the Sprites folder, select the last *two* sprites from the Player32x32 sprite-sheet, titled: `Player32x32_12` and `Player32x32_13` and drag them onto the PlayerObject. When prompted by the Create New Animation save window, name the created animation-clip, "player-idle" and save to the Animations -> Animations folder.

Make sure to attach the `RoundCameraPos` script to the virtual camera object. Drag and drop the `RoundCameraPos` onto "CM vcam1".

The interface has been updated in Unity 2018.3. The menu item "Edit Physics Shape" has been renamed to "Custom Physics Shape". After selecting Custom Physics Shape, click the "Generate" button on the right before editing.

Create the GameObject in the hierarchy view (not project view).

In the **Build the Consumable Script** section, third paragraph, note that there is a distinction between the behavior of Scriptable Objects when running a project in the Editor, versus when running in a deployed (to device) build: Scriptable Objects cannot be used to _save_ changes to data in a deployed build. More on this subject can be read [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html).

In the **Assembling Our Item** section, third paragraph, rename the Scriptable Object, "Coin" (not "Item").

In the **Player Collisions** section, the first line of code section `// 3`, should be:

```
print("Hit: " + hitObject.objectName);
```

Under the heading **Create the HealthBar Script**, right-click in the MonoBehaviours folder **and create a new C# script** called HealthBar."

Ensure a copy of the `HealthBarObject` is in the Hierarchy view and select it. Add the HealthBar script this HealthBarObject. When working with the HealthBar in these next 3 pages (202-204), work with the copy of `HealthBarObject` in the Hierarchy view, not the copy in the Prefab folder. Make sure to apply changes when you're done, so the changes propagate to the Prefab.

**Note**: The location of the button to apply changes to a prefab has changed in Unity 2018. The button is now located in the top right of the Inspector, in a drop-down menu called Overrides.

The property, `Character Category` which appears in the source and in Figure 6-22 may be disregarded, or used later on in your game to broadly distinguish between what is/isn't an enemy, or the player (or even an NPC) instead of creating a tag for each character type.

With `InventoryObject` selected, in the Canvas Scaler component, set `Reference Pixels Per Unit` to 32.

In the **The DamageCharacter() method** section, the code should be added to the `Enemy` class.

In the **Refactoring Prefab Instantiation** section, remove all *four* lines from `Start()` and add them to the new `ResetCharacter()` override.

After you add the `ResetCharacter()` method to the `Player` class, add the following method

```
private void OnEnable() {
	ResetCharacter();
}
```

You'll notice when you run into the enemies they spin. Like you did with the PlayerObject, check `Freeze Rotation` for the Z axis inside the Rigidbody2D on the EnemyObject prefab.

In the **Enemy Walk Animation** section, select the Enemy prefab then open the **Animator** window as seen in Figure 8-3.

In the implementation of the `GetQuadrant()` method, disregard the first two variable declarations: `Vector2 mousePosition = Input.mousePosition;` and `Vector2 playerPosition = transform.position;` as they are not used.

#### Chapter 8, Page 360

In the method `UpdateState()`, the case for `Quadrant.West:` should be changed from: `quadrantVector = new Vector2(-1.0f, 1.0f);` to `quadrantVector = new Vector2(-1.0f, 0.0f);`
